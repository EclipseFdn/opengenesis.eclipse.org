## Mission

The mission of the openGENESIS Working Group is to provide methods and tools for the assessment of artificial intelligence (AI) used for autonomous driving. AI algorithms should be proved to be safe and roadworthy before deployed to public road.  
The working group openGENESIS drives and supports the investigations of a verifiable, understandable and not least certifiable AI. The working group will supply public and regulation authorities with necessary approaches to deal with the challenges of approval and certification of AI.

openGENESIS provides a collaboration platform for knowledge exchange among members. The members can cooperate with each other efficiently and provide the results in an open access domain. openGENESIS enables research with direct access to practice and safety relevant challenges.

## Scope and Objectives

The highly challenging task to enable assessing AI for the safety critical case of autonomous driving will be addressed by global collaboration among industry, research and regulators. To equip this collaboration with the necessary framework, the openGENESIS working group will coordinate and support the activities on the following topics:

*   Develop necessary methods, tools and metrics for verification and validation of AI
*   Support the evolution of functional safety approaches for AI
*   Establish an open accessible platform for AI training and validation data sets
*   Drive the aspects and discussion of reproducibility and explainability of AI
*   Encourage and support academic research efforts within the scope of openGENESIS
*   Support a global collaboration and drive a common understanding of quality of AI
*   Maintain the scope as well as the objectives of the openGENESIS working group
*   Coordinate the development of related Eclipse Foundation projects towards an openGENESIS objective.
*   Define and manage the specifications for interfaces and functions for the working group.
